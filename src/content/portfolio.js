    "It was 2019 when I started my Bachelor.s in Computer Science and Engineering. Why? Because everyone said the same thing: AI is the future, and you have to be a part of it. So that’s exactly what I decided to do. I started from the very basics, learned everything from scratch: the math behind it and other underlying concepts. I eventually started my career implementing AI-based solutions for automotive and medical industries, working with large-scale service-based organizations. As my experience grew, my role evolved beyond pure technical work. I began working on business analysis and helping organizations strategize roadmaps for company-wide AI implementation, particularly within startups. This phase of my career made me fall in love with the management and strategy side of businesses. Working with and for the problems of several Fortune 100 companies gave me a deep understanding of how these giants operate and the complexity behind decision-making at that level. Everything eventually pushed me further in this direction. In 2025, I joined EDHEC Business School to pursue a Master’s in Strategy, Organisation and Consulting. Here I worked with organizations such as BCG Inverto, Capgemini Invent, L’Oréal, and many more, gaining even deeper exposure to strategic problem-solving and high-level business decision-making. After all these experiences and achievements I realised something: If you love your business, understand technology, have enough creativity to imagine possibilities, and can communicate your ideas clearly, then you should be working with, or becoming a part of, the teams that shape a company’s direction, mission, and vision. Because those are the people who truly determine where organizations go. Reaching that level is not something that happens overnight, but every leader I have known or met shares a common trait: they are, in many ways, jack-of-all-trades. They have almost covered everything in each level and rapidly moved onto higher levels. That is what I aspire to become: A good leader. AN EXPERT JACK OF ALL TRADES!"

      "From 2019 to today (2026), take it from someone who started with AI when there was no chatgpt or any gen-AI, just plain old regression and prediction models, and neural networks; AI has grown exponentially big. Me and my friends would discuss how AI will actually be in the future 5 years, and trust me when I say this: Today's scenario is eerily close to what we imagined/predicted back in 2019. AI has become a part of our daily lives, whether you accept it or not. Even our universities and workplaces are encouraging the use of AI, do you see how sticky it has become? Thats the biggest achievement any product can make, its becoming sticky. Being sticky refers to something becoming a part of so many things and processes that you can no more avoid using it. Its in your life already. I personally believe that AI is a part of our evolution. If you havent noticed it already, our attention span, as well as mental calculation/creativity/imagination has reduced quite a bit. We often find ourselves offloading a lot of these tasks to AI, you just take your phone out and use your favorite AI's mobile app for almost everything. Am I against it? Nope. But you gotta make sure that with AI, you are better, faster and more productive. So if you are still not there yet, jump onto the train as fast as you can, because everyone else around you is there.
